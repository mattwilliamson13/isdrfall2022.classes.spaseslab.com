To do that, you'll have to have a bit more of a foundation in coordinates, coordinate reference systems, and geometries and how to access those in `R`. We'll start there today and move into functions that change or relate geometries in the next few classes.\n\n## Readings\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> The introductory vignette for the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) has a lot of useful info on `sf` objects and conventions.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> [Section 2.2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html) on Vector Data and [Sections 5.1-5.3](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html) on Geographic Operations in Lovelace et al. [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019] - for more details about vectors and geometric operations on vectors.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Chapter 2, Sections 1-3](https://r-spatial.org/book/02-Spaces.html) and [Chapter 3, Section 1](https://r-spatial.org/book/03-Geometries.html) of Spatial Data Science by Edzer Pebesma and Roger Bivand (of the `sf`, `sp`, `rgeos`, and `rgdal` packages)\n\n## Objectives\n\nBy the end of today, you should be able to: \n\n* Define coordinate, coordinate system, datum, and coordinate reference system\n\n* Access coordinate and geometry information for simple features in `R`\n\n* Understand the rules for simple feature geometries\n\n* Access and transform the coordinate reference system for vector and raster data in `R`\n\n\n\n\n## Slides\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
