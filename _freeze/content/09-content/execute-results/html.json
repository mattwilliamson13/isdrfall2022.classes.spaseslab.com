We'll be using the `terra` package for the majority of raster options in this course primarily because it of its speed. That said, it is not a `tidyverse` package and so some of the intuition we used to organize the `sf` functions will be a little harder to extend here. I'll do my best to help you make the links!!\n\n## Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> [Chapter 4](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/the-terra-package-for-raster-and-vector-data.html) from Paula Moraga's Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with R provides a quick intro to using `terra` for raster and vector data.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> [The `terra` reference page](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html) provides a brief overview of all of the functions and their categories. We'll only focus on the `SpatRaster` methods.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> [Raster Data Manipulation](https://rspatial.org/spatial/8-rastermanip.html) from the Spatial Data Science with `R` and `terra` ebook provides some nice examples of `terra` functions in the context of spatial workflows.\n\n\n\n## Objectives\n\nBy the end of today, you should be able to: \n\n- Access the elements that define a raster\n\n- Build rasters from scratch using matrix operations and `terra`\n\n- Evaluate logical conditions with raster data\n\n- Calculate different measures of raster data\n\n## Slides\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
