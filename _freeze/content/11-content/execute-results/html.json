Transformations allow you to actually manipulate the geometries of a vector object (without necessarily changing the attributes themselves) and are a powerful tool for geting disparate data into some logical alignment. That said, transforming geometries can be complicated and often has some unanticipated consequences. That's why we spent a little bit of time learning the mapping syntax as a means for you to be able to check yourself.\n\n## Readings\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> The introductory vignette for the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) has a lot of useful info on `sf` objects and conventions.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> [Section 2.2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html) on Vector Data and [Sections 5.1-5.3](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html) on Geographic Operations in Lovelace et al. [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019] - for more details about vectors and geometric operations on vectors.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Section 3.1 and 3.2](https://r-spatial.org/book/03-Geometries.html) of Spatial Data Science, a `bookdown` project by Edzer Pebesma and Roger Bivand (of the `sf`, `sp`, `rgeos`, and `rgdal` packages).\n\n\n## Objectives\n\nBy the end of today, you should be able to: \n\n* Recognize the unary, binary, and n-ary transformers\n\n* Articulate common uses for unary and binary transformers\n\n* Use unary transformations to fix invalid geometries\n\n* Implement common binary transformers to align and combine data\n\n## Slides\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
