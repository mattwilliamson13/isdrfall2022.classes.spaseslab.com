We'll start with some of the basic transformations that operate on the entire dataset then move to some of the important cell-wise operations.\n\n## Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> The [`terra` package vignette](https://rspatial.org/terra/pkg/1-introduction.html#) describes the new raster functions available in `terra`, their relationship to those in the `raster` package, and the changes in syntax between the two.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> The [Raster GIS Operations in R with terra](https://www.ecologi.st/spatial-r/raster-gis-operations-in-r-with-terra.html) chapter from Jasper Slingsby's \"A Minimal Introduction to GIS (in R)\" bookdown project has worked examples of many of the operations we'll learn today.\n\n## Objectives\n\nBy the end of today, you should be able to: \n\n- Align rasters for spatial processing\n\n- Adjust the resolution of raster data\n\n- Combine (or reduce) rasters to match the extent of your analysis\n\n## Slides\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
