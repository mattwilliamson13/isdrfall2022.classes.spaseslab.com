At this point, we'll be focusing on rough visualization as a way of \"gut-checking\" the outcomes of your code. We'll focus more on creating informative, aesthetically pleasing, publication quality visualizations.\n\n\n## Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Ch.3 Tmap in a nutshell](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap-book/nutshell.html) from \"Elegant and informative maps with tmap\" by Martijn Tennekes and Jakub Nowosad provides a great \"quick start\" for using the `tmap` package for visualizing spatial data.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Making maps with `R`](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html) by [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019] introduces the `tmap` package for making nice maps with relatively minimal syntax.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Making maps in `R`](https://www.emilyburchfield.org/courses/eds/making_maps_in_r) by Emily Burchfield illustrates some quick mapping syntax with base `plot`, `ggplot`, and `tmap`. For now, just focus on the base `plot` and `tmap` sections as we'll take on the ggplot stuff later in the course.\n\n## Objectives\n\nBy the end of today, you should be able to: \n\n*   Describe the basic components of data visualization as a foundation for mapping syntax\n\n*   Understand layering in both base `plot` and `tmap`\n\n*   Make basic plots of multiple spatial data objects\n\n## Slides\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
