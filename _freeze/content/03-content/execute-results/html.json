This lecture will be a little more conceptual, but is designed to help you make some sense for how `R` thinks about spatial data (or at least how the package developers have been thinking about it).\n\n## Readings\n\n{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Types of Spatial Data](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/types-of-spatial-data.html) from Paula Moraga's new book Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with `R` provides a nice overview of the types of spatial data from the perspective of a statistical analyst.\n\n{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Attributes and Support](https://r-spatial.org/book/05-Attributes.html) from Pebesma and Bivand's Spatial Data Science with Applications in `R` gives more info and examples on the nature of the relationship between geometries and support.\n\n{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Scale and Projections](https://open.lib.umn.edu/mapping/chapter/3-scale-and-projections/) from Mapping, Society, and Technology by Laura Matson and Melinda Kernik gives a nice overview of the challenges associated with representing location on Earth's surface.\n\n## Objectives\nBy the end of today you should be able to:\n\n\n* **Contrast** the different \"views\" of spatial data and their incorporation in GIS.\n\n* **Identify** key elements that make data \"spatial\".\n\n* **Articulate** the importance of coordinate reference systems.\n\n* **Recognize** the relationship between geometries and support.\n\n\n## Slides\n\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
