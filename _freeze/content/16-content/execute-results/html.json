It can be difficult to link all of the steps of filtering, selecting, extracting, etc into a coherent problem when you are just being exposed to the syntax (as we discovered last week). Today, I'll try to use a motivating example to help you see a path forward.\n\n## Resources\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> The [Spatial Data Operations Chapter](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html) in [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019] makes the concepts of a network concrete (literally) by using a transportation route example to illustrate the various components of a network analysis in `R`.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i>  [Chapter 3. Processing Tabular Data](https://bookdown.org/mcwimberly/gdswr-book/tables.html) from _Geographic Data Science with R_ by Michael C. Wimberly has a nice introduction to many of the `dplyr` verbs for manipulating tabular data.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i>  [Chapter 9. Combining Vector Data with Continuous Raster Data](https://bookdown.org/mcwimberly/gdswr-book/combining-vector-data-with-continuous-raster-data.html) from _Geographic Data Science with R_ by Michael C. Wimberly introduces data extraction and zonal statistics for raster data.\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i>  [Chapter 10. Combining Vector Data with Discrete Raster Data](https://bookdown.org/mcwimberly/gdswr-book/tables.html) from _Geographic Data Science with R_ by Michael C. Wimberly extends Chapter 9 for discrete rasters, but also adds some additional buffering and data manipulation syntax.\n\n## Objectives\n\nBy the end of today you should be able to:\n\n- Use `dplyr` with `predicates` and `measures` to subset and manipulate data\n\n- Use `extract` to access raster data\n\n- Use `zonal` to summarize access data\n\n- Join data into a single analyzable dataframe\n\n## Slides\n\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
